Simple, Fast & Secure frontend management of posts - Add, Edit, Delete posts from frontend - Full featured frontend management of posts.
  
== Description ==

WordPress Frontier Post Plugin enables simple full featured management of standard posts from frontend for all user roles.

Intention of the Frontier Post plugin is to enable front end posting and editing on your blog. Allowing your users to create content easy, with no need to go into the back-end.
Editors and Administrators can use Frontier to edit posts from the frontend (Can be enabled/disabled in settings), and at the same time go to the backend for more advanced options.

Frontier Post is intentionally made simple - But it is highly configuable if you want to extend it :)
